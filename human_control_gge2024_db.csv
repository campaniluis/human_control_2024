UNITED KINGDOM,12:23:24,0:00:00,0:08:04,"Mr. Chair, in brief, the answer to the question does compliance with IHL depend on the use of laws in a specific context, the answer is yes. As we have said before, international humanitarian law is principle based and it looks at how a weapon is used and its effect and it applies to all weapon systems autonomous or not. Turning to the specific bullets, [...] [...] the third bullet which speaks to the nature of human machine interaction is a critical issue in relation to how the autonomous weapon system will be used in a lawful manner, rather a factor of lawfulness in itself. All of this speaks to context, so the first three of the bullets here need to be reframed in that regard. In relation to the third and fourth bullets where we see reference to life cycle in two of the options, the UK position is that context appropriate human involvement engages human involvement in a manner and at a point that is necessary to ensure the use of the autonomous weapon system complies with IHL. The life cycle is important to ensure that the commander can affect the necessary controls and constraints whether they be to the environment of use or the operation of the system itself. This is not just technological in nature. It cuts across technology development and testing, training and operationalization of systems, development of operating procedures, training of personnel involved in the use of laws, decisions made regarding where and when to use your laws and mechanisms for reporting and feeding back concerns regarding the use of those systems. Therefore, the UK would suggest bullet 3 and 4 could read context appropriate human involvement across the life cycle of the AWS is necessary to ensure that the use of AWS is in compliance with IHL. Bullet 5 is the critical bullet in relation to the types of considerations and constraints that might depending on context support the subjective, the objective of compliance with IHL. The UK would suggest further clarity is needed in focus of this further clarity is needed in focus of this bullet such as who or what are we referring to when we refer to the operator. Is this the state using the autonomous system or the person who is operating the system sitting at the controls? Or everyone across the chain of command involving decisions to deploy and use the laws. We note and agree with the ICRC's comments in this regard to clarify and broaden the application of the term operators. In relation to limitations on space and time of targets, duration of operation, geographic scope and scale of use, geographic and temporal constraints are indeed sensible. Limitation on target types are obvious but the risk of misidentification of entity or target type in terms of complex targets would need to be taken into account. The UK would expect the human operator to be able to limit and vary the behavior of the laws depending on the context of use. This might include geographic and temporal constraints, permissible behaviors and levels of autonomy.",[04] Support,"The UK would expect the human operator to be able to limit and vary the behavior of the laws depending on the context of use.

ISRAEL,11:16:56,0:00:00,0:04:06,"Under IHL, the use of weapons systems that are not categorically prohibited under the existing rules applicable to the legality per se of weapons, which we referred to yesterday, would be governed by IHL rules that apply to the conduct of hostilities and in particular the targeting rules of IHL. [...] Therefore, there are three interdependent aspects for assessing the implementation of relevant IHL rules. First, the technical characteristics and capabilities of a weapons system. Second, the human element. And third, the operational context. To comprehensively assess the legalities of laws, it is crucial to consider all three aspects together. As mentioned by Australia, the human element or human involvement is integrated at various stages of the life cycle of weapons systems. Consideration of the three aspects needs to provide sufficient assurance that the employment of the weapons system would be in conformity with applicable law, rules of engagement and the intentions of its users. The appropriate degree of foreseeability and predictability of the weapons operation as well as the type and level of human machine interaction will be determined by the characteristics and capabilities of the particular system in question in view of the operational circumstances and the mission's requirements.

SWITZERLAND,10:51:21,0:00:00,0:11:56,"On the first sentence, the legality of laws depends on, we agree in principle, but would rather say that legality depends on compliance with the law and to do so, human control involvement alongside with other measures are necessary. Human control is not an absolute value, nor is it an abstract concept. Rather, human control is a specific tool and the specific type of control needed depends on situational factors. And this brings me to the first bullet, the operational context, the characteristics and capabilities of autonomous weapons as well as the anticipated targets all matter and influence the determination whether the use of an autonomous weapon in an attack complies with IHL. On the third bullet, point on human control, the starting point is that autonomous weapons must operate in compliance with international law and within a framework that ensures a sufficient degree of and a type of human control over the entire life cycle of a weapon system. This is vitally important because when using an autonomous weapon system, as with any weapon system, it is humans who must ensure legal conformity and in particular compliance with IHL under all circumstances. This is why the role of humans in the use of autonomous weapon systems has emerged as the central element in ensuring compliance with IHL. And moreover, we now have a shared understanding that certain degree of control over the use of force is not only necessary to comply with IHL but it is also important from an operational perspective and in terms of ethical accessibility. For a long time, we had quite intense discussions about terminology. We are of the view that last year we reached a point where differences in mere terminology carry less weight, whether we call it human machine interaction, human judgment, human involvement or whatever objective we put in front of human control.

PAKISTAN,10:57:09,0:00:00,0:07:36,"Mr. Chair, we believe like many others that autonomy is across the spectrum. The spectrum ranges from fully manual systems where humans make all critical decisions to fully autonomous systems which can select and engage targets without further human intervention. However, when we dissect the term "" autonomous "" in the strictest sense, we encounter a dichotomy that transcends the idea of a spectrum. This means the ability of the system to operate without human input or intervention in the critical loop of decision making, particularly in selecting and engaging targets. In fact, this dichotomy suggests that while we can discuss the degree of autonomy a weapon system possesses reflected in how much it relies on human inputs for its operations, at the point of being labeled autonomous, the system crosses a definitive threshold. Beyond this threshold, a weapon system is capable of executing critical operational decisions such as selecting and engaging targets. This capacity for independent operation without the need for a direct human control in realtime decision making encapsulates the absolute nature of autonomy. In other words, while the development and operational context of weapon system might involve a nuanced spectrum of human machine interaction and collaboration, the classification of system as autonomous is binary. It either possesses the capability to independently carry out critical decision making processes or it does not. This binary distinction also underscores the importance of having a clear understanding on the scope of our work and on the scope of autonomous weapon systems, highlighting the profound implications of crossing the threshold from assisted or semi-autonomous operations or with some sort of automation to full autonomy, which will also inform our work in the regulations.

In many ways this is a result of attempts to introduce in our discussions certain notions, for example, such a notion as meaningful human control, the level of human involvement and forms of such involvement and also other new notions. And also the result of including the list of definitions related to laws of certain categories that represent assessments rather than representing legal concepts and we believe that such approaches do not contribute to the effective solutions of these questions and also moreover such subjective characteristics as significant or important will carry the risks of politicizing our discussions. The definition of lethal autonomous weapon systems purely on the basis of meaningful or rather human control will hardly contribute to finding a mutually acceptable understanding of such systems due to the lack of any agreed criteria of ensuring human control over machines.

AUSTRALIA,10:32:48,0:00:00,0:07:18,"The first point we would like to make is that the concepts of human control. So turning to the first set of elements, the first point we would like to make is that the concepts of human control or meaningful human control are not terms found in existing IHL. Australia's concerns with terminology like meaningful human control are well known. We consider this phrase vague and subject to differing interpretations and therefore not overly helpful in clarifying how IHL applies to laws or giving concrete guidance to states on how to ensure compliance with IHL. A weapon will always be a tool rather than a replacement for a human. The idea of a weapon system operating in the absence of any human involvement or control or what some Delegations describe as fully autonomous weapon systems is also somewhat implausible from our perspective, since a human will always be involved in programming, activating or setting parameters for the weapon system. Regarding how we conceptualize human control and involvement in the context of the two-tier approach, we note that IHL addresses the legality of weapons in two ways. Firstly, it prohibits types of weapons based on intrinsic characteristics and effects and secondly, it restricts certain uses of otherwise lawful weapons.

UNITED KINGDOM,17:07:50,0:00:00,0:05:44,"Turning to the second paragraph, we find this paragraph problematic. Like other Delegations, the UK recognizes the importance of addressing the issue of nominal control and the need to ensure that a system is not excluded by virtue of such nominal involvement. The UK also welcomes the inclusion and recognition of the UK's concept of context appropriate human involvement and notions of judgment. The UK expects that we will come back to these questions including what context appropriate means when we speak about potential measures to address the issues raised by autonomous weapon systems. That said, the current framing of this paragraph undermines the way in which many states, the UK included, understand the concept of context appropriate human involvement. It is certainly not the case that weapon systems that only require nominal human input after activation cannot operate with context appropriate human involvement and judgment. Depending on the context of use and the nature of the autonomous functions of the weapon system, appropriate human involvement can be applied at other stages of the system's life cycle, not just when in use or post activation. Examples include development, test and acceptance of the system and via decisions made by commanders to deploy a particular system in a theater operation and use it in a particular situation. Priority use controls can also be applied for the bounding of autonomous behaviors and placing geographic and temporal limits. While it is true that autonomous weapon systems can include systems that can operate without intervention or with only nominal intervention post activation, the same weapon may be able to be used with various levels of autonomy. Therefore, any agreed characterization should not equate the ability to operate without intervention or with only nominal intervention as the sole operating model for these systems. Lastly, context appropriate human involvement and human judgment are required for the operation of all weapon systems in accordance with international law, including autonomous systems.

UNITED STATES,11:08:49,0:00:00,0:08:49,"I am particularly interested in further exploring the Delegation of Pakistan's observations about the binary nature of autonomy. I think when we agreed in this body to characterize autonomy as falling within a spectrum, we were trying to capture a broader idea which is that the type of autonomous features and functions that could be incorporated into a weapon system fall within a fairly broad spectrum. I think that was just a reflection of the emerging nature of many technologies that you have more rudimentary technologies, you have more advanced technologies, you have the types of machine learning and other technologies that are now being very actively focused on, but that when you think about it, the types of autonomous features and functions that could be incorporated theoretically into a weapon system fall within a fairly wide range. But I do agree that there is a binary point and it is this binary point that I wanted to focus on. It is the point at which and I think this is part of the way the Delegation of Pakistan explained the challenge that we are facing. It is the point at which the weapon system ceases to operate with the involvement of the human operator that deployed and activated the system. And so I think we would agree that that point, that moment in time, that point in time is or it can be binary. I think there may be weapon systems that have an ability to continue to engage, but we are focused on those systems that have reached that point that they are no longer operating with the involvement of the operator. And so that is what we are really focusing on and why we had made some of the earlier suggestions that we made. The Russian definition, Chair, that you focused us on, that I now am looking at, I think one of the concerns that we have with this definition and maybe it is just a question for the Russian Federation to help us understand how they see this binary moment, if the Pakistani Delegation and the US Delegation are understanding it in the same way, where is that moment in their definition? It is a bit unclear to our Delegation and this really gets at the point that the Delegation of Australia just made about sort of where are we in the life cycle? So this is ambiguous on that question. It appears to posit that there is a weapon system that is out there. It is unclear how the weapon system got out there, who put the weapon system out there, how it was deployed, when it was activated. It is just out there. And that the definition would then capture that weapon system only if it operated without any involvement. So what we see is missing from the definition is where the person, the engagement of the operator, the engagement of the human being is taking place. I think the definition that you have been guiding us through is clear on that point. The idea is that it is the operator that has decided to use the weapon, has decided to use it in a particular context, has activated the system that is being used and that at that moment in time it is, as the Pakistani said, it is past that binary moment.

IRELAND,15:27:09,0:00:00,0:03:09,"These fruitful and substantive discussions and the format you have chosen, we believe this is the way forward towards increasing convergence on the topic. Chair, autonomous weapons systems pose various challenges with regard to IHL. In particular, this includes factors such as unpredictability, the complex context based decisions necessary in the application of force, the need for qualitative human judgment and algorithmic biases. We need only point to the abundance of scientific, academic and civil society research contributions in these areas which underline time and again the value of human centrality. The pressing need to address the issue of explainability in AI and addressing bias and ethical considerations more broadly. A specific question of which elements, characteristics or characteristics would make autonomous weapons systems incompatible with IHL, we would point more broadly that this should refer to autonomous weapons systems that cannot distinguish between military and civilian targets. This is particularly relevant to autonomous weapons systems which rely on artificial intelligence techniques, on machine learning and which prevent the human user from being able to understand, predict or explain the system's output. This impossibility effectively results in a lack of control over the weapons effects, making it potentially indiscriminate by nature. We refer here to what is commonly called the black box challenge and which refers to the design of autonomous weapons systems that arrive at conclusions or decisions without providing any explanation as to how they were reached. Additionally, and as our colleagues in the ICRC have highlighted, in such systems, target selection is based on a generalized target profile that is unlikely to be able to account for the non-exhaustive range of contextual signals showing that a person is protected from attack. Whilst the user or commander may have made a general assessment that one or more people in the area constitutes a lawful target at the time of launching the autonomous weapons system, those people's actions, intentions and physical state and hence their qualification as a lawful target can change rapidly. The IHL rule on distinction requires assessment on the concrete circumstances prevailing at the relevant time and place. By definition, Chair, these types of systems cannot comply with IHL as their function cannot employ the IHL principles of distinction and proportionality.

And we are very much appreciated that you have taken this up also here as a prohibition part in para 5. What probably is the issue here is that it is not defined yet. But we think this could be part of or should be part of our work. As others we would prefer human control here as the term and what we suggest in our working paper is that human control or meaningful human control which we would even prefer more as something that could be achieved through a mix of positive obligations.

MEXICO,11:36:09,0:00:00,0:07:50,"[...] For Mexico, as we have said within this Working Group, autonomy implies the incorporation of emerging technologies in the compilation processing of functions that are on the margin of human intervention. And that autonomy is what links this topic to those technologies. We do welcome the definition by the United States, though, and Germany for those Delegations, activation is what establishes that clear indispensable link with the systems technology. And that is something that we will take into account as we prepare for our future discussions. I think that the discussion about the term once activated has opened up other topics for discussion, for instance, whether that activation must be done by a human or whether it could be automatic activation or autonomous activation as the Russian Federation was pointing towards. For Mexico, this characteristic would be determined depending on the viability of human involvement at the time of engagement [...] and the use of force. Still regarding the term once activated, Mexico believes we should consider autonomous weapons in the full spectrum. So the term once activated could be a practical consideration of the weapons operation, but it does not exclude the measures that this group of experts will have to consider, especially as regards the design, development, legal assessment in accordance with Article 36, its deployment and its use. This is in keeping with what Costa Rica said during the general debate when they spoke on behalf of the G15. With regard to critical functions and what they should be, Mexico believes that the process through which autonomous weapons systems select targets, engage targets and apply force against them without human intervention is essential. For us, human intervention must be meaningful in order for the process to be compliant with international humanitarian law. Therefore, we agree with Pakistan that we need clarity about the fact that in the weapons full spectrum there must be a meaningful human decision at the level of critical functions.

It is subject to divergent understandings. It is clearly not found consensus and my Delegation provided a working paper in 2018 that explains our perspective and discusses in detail why we do not find this to be a particularly helpful term.

We view states and individuals as responsible for the use of autonomous weapon systems and we are concerned with this language because it suggests that responsibility is only a commitment and that, in fact, machines could be responsible.

RUSSIAN FEDERATION,10:40:37,0:00:00,0:10:21,"So here the question of human control in this context is divided into two parts. The first part relates to existing norms and principles of IHL that relate to the need to ensure such human control, and this is done in a general way. And the second part relates to specific measures that make it possible to ensure such human control and the realization and compliance in the correct way with existing principles of IHL related to such human control for all weapon systems, specifically as it relates to laws. Now, if we look at the first part of this question, so one of the important elements of limitations is what we see, the need to ensure limitations on human control through the intervention of a human operator or the system of management at a higher level in order to change the regime of the functioning of such systems, including partial or full deactivation. And in all of that, we still continue to believe that in light of the responsibilities that states have and the responsibilities that individuals have in terms of the design and employment of weapon systems, the specific methods and forms of human control have to be left up to states to determine and decide. And in all of this, such human control should not necessarily be imposed through direct control, direct management. Now, if we look at the second part of this question and try to in a general way determine specific means and measures of ensuring such control, then some of these measures have already been reflected in last year's report of the GGE in paragraph 22, and I am referring to limitations in terms of types of targets, limitations related to the duration of the function geographical scope and scale of the use, and also in terms of the participation in the control or management of individuals that have successfully acquired the skills for using such lethal autonomous weapon systems. Now, in addition to that, we also would like to propose to consider such methods of ensuring human control as increasing the reliability of weapon systems and their failure rate, the timely intervention and deactivation, carrying out tests of lethal autonomous weapon systems in realistic operational conditions, control of the process of manufacturing of separate elements and the device as a whole, as well as monitoring of pre-sorting and use disposal of certain elements and the device as a whole. I would once again like to especially stress the point that we are only talking about such methods methods in a general way. Specific forms of ensuring such human control through such methods should be left up to states to decide.

However, we believe that human control is context specific. Therefore, it is of particular importance to us, to Germany, that certain self-defense systems such as the patriot missile system can and must be able to operate in an automatic mode without human intervention after activation without posing any international humanitarian law related or ethical challenges. Once activated, such systems are designed to automatically detect, select and engage targets without further human interaction when required by time critical factors, engagement of very fast targets such as artillery or in the case of missile defense. With regard to the rolling text, Germany would appreciate some clarification on the second paragraph. As far as we understand it, the addition of nominal human input would contradict the first paragraph which clearly states that laws are systems that operate outside human control and the responsible chain of command and select and engage the target without further intervention by a human operator.

We agree with the Distinguished Representative of the United States that we should not necessarily narrow down our discussion and that autonomy exists on the spectrum. For a long time, automation has been integrated into weapon systems. A common definition of automation is the ability of a system to perform a given task without human intervention. Classical automation is rule based and usually there is a deterministic relation between the input the system receives and the output that it generates. Such systems are relatively predictable, but with the introduction of new technology such as artificial intelligence, systems can become goal oriented and self-directed instead of rule based and deterministic. Usually such goal oriented and self-directed systems are referred to with the term autonomous instead of automated, but we believe that both automated and autonomous systems can be placed on the spectrum of autonomy and as such, both automated and automated autonomous systems are the subject of our discussions.

In theory, all it would require for a system to fall outside the scope of the framework of autonomous weapon system is a single human input after the system's activation. It is thus critical to define what we mean by without a human intervention. For example, if a human user was required to press a keyboard button after the system's activation in order for force to be executed without any moral or legal considerations of the consequences, would this amount to a human intervention and therefore take the weapon outside the definition of an oath? In other words, would the mindless click of a keyboard button by a human after the system's activation lead the system to fall outside the oath framework and thus the framework containing prohibitions and regulations including the need for meaningful human control? Would not apply to that weapon system at all? The interpretation would be not only completely counterintuitive but more importantly, it would make the framework toothless and undermine all the progress made within these discussions so far. Indeed, a number of weapon companies are priding themselves with developing autonomous weapons with the minimum level of a human input necessary. Such systems claim to fail to fall outside the definition of an oath. They claim to fall outside the definition of an oath because they require a human input. However, insignificant after the system is activated, it is apparent from analysis of the vast range of weapon systems incorporating autonomy that almost all of them allow a human to engage with the system with a nominal human input after the system's activation. Despite being nominal, weapons designers and manufacturers are able to avoid the system being labeled as an autonomous weapon system by suggesting that an intervention can be made after the system's activation, thereby taking it out of the scope of autonomous weapon system. Our working paper submitted at this GGE last year problematized this issue and closed this loophole by introducing the concept of nominal human input and to generate substantive engagement by states and other stakeholders with this area of thought. We define a nominal human input as an input performed by a human after the system's activation and during the autonomous process, but that does not materially affect the process. A human input will not materially affect the autonomous process if it does not bring to bear any wider information to inform decisions to select and engage a target with force. In other words, no further human moral and legal reflection is occurring during that human input. These nominal human inputs are made at a place and time far removed from where the system executes force and without the human giving proper consideration to the risks of breaches under international law taking place. The human input is thus mindless, its effect being the same as if the autonomous process had occurred without it. We must adopt an appropriate definition of autonomous weapon system that enables these systems to be brought under the scope of potential prohibitions and regulations. Ultimately, this requires a clarity that a nominal human input does not amount to an intervention for the purpose of the otherwise sound definition that states are around. And if such an input is made, the system should still be considered. We therefore strongly disagree with the interventions made by states yesterday that this clarification can be deleted or removed to a different section of the paper. On the contrary, this is a crucial aspect to include in the characterization section to make that the framework has applicability to the real world. Further details on what is meant by a nominal human input is set out in the working paper submitted by state of Palestine in March 2023 to this GGE and we invite states to read it.",,,,,,,[04] Support,"TGT/ENG: However, insignificant after the system is activated, it is apparent from analysis of the vast range of weapon systems incorporating autonomy that almost all of them allow a human to engage with the system with a nominal human input after the system's activation.

It is not yet a definition of human control or how this applies. This is something that we have to do at some other part which is probably way more important but I will come to that. On the question of lethality, we are of the same position as Belgium. This word is not very useful and not needed in our discussion. It rather creates confusion and we would happily drop the lethal even in the title of our Working Group. In general, we also think a precise definition is not needed for provision of certain types of autonomous weapon systems for us to continue our discussions. At the same time, it is, of course, useful and we see that there is a need from a number of Delegations for us to move forward. We would consider this then as a working definition and if we go into that direction, we find the definition by the ICRC as the most useful and sufficient one which describes autonomous weapon systems as weapons of select and apply force to targets without human intervention. Coming to the text here, we see some useful additions to that. I think technologies that enable is useful as it implies a technology neutral approach. This is also something we have advocated many times before. If we address function of autonomy and weapon systems, it is much more useful than talking about categories of weapons. Such an approach was already promoted in the past by states but also it can be found in several Chair's papers in summaries of previous years going back many years. It takes into account the fact that almost any weapon system can incorporate autonomous functions and systems are becoming more and more complex. We see an inherent risk that too much detailed deliberations might be overtaken by technological developments. That is why a technological neutral approach is so important and by inserting this little part here at the beginning proposed by three states, I think we are taking this into account. Once activated is probably also a useful addition in the rest as mentioned before, we prefer the well established and also age old formulations by the ICRC which is select and engage, apply force and the human intervention.

Furthermore, this suggests that a partially autonomous weapon system will fall under this characterization but it does not specify at which point, ie, where is the nominal human involvement or absence thereof in the kill chain to render it an autonomous weapon system? Is it at target identification, the selection or the initiation of an attack?

ITALY,10:24:31,0:00:00,0:05:42,"There are, of course, different views on whether we should simply refer to human intervention or whether we should talk instead of intervention by a human operator. Human intervention is certainly broader, but it lacks the element of agency that the reference to the operator implies. There is perhaps more work to do on this, but to come up with a formulation that could work both ways. In general terms, we think that this characterization of laws is rather broad as to cover all laws and it should be as broad as possible as it would form the basis for the definition of laws in a future instrument. For instance, we think it is better to use here only select and engage rather than identify, select, track and engage as this might leave out a number of systems. The way we read the first paragraph is that the key moment is activation. The last moment a human intervenes and then the system can engage and can select and engage a target by itself. As this is phrased, the system can also be deactivated by a human before it selects and engages or it can self-destruct if certain conditions are not met before it engages. The characterization in this first paragraph works for us because it is rather broad and as such can apply to a broad range of systems with different levels of autonomy. We can start from this and then work all the way down to a characterization of fully autonomous laws, in other words, systems that can select and engage and that cannot be stopped once activated so that they are completely out of human control once activated. And then from that, from fully autonomous laws, we further restrict the characterization with those systems that violate IHL so that we can ban those two. And then what is left are those systems that we will regulate according to the two-tier approach. In this way, characterization will help us determine prohibitions and regulations. Besides positive characterization, it would also be useful to say explicitly what is not an autonomous weapons system. We think that this is good for conceptual clarity to avoid interpretive misunderstandings in a future instrument. This is why we support Paragraph 3, although perhaps the list is not exhaustive. For instance, I would like to refer to what Germany said at the beginning of our debate concerning fully automated defensive anti-missile systems. However, we also share the approach of referring to what is not laws, not in the characterization of laws but rather in the scope of a future instrument, explicitly leaving out of its scope certain weapons systems, mines, munitions or ordinance. As far as Paragraph 2 is concerned, we understand the idea behind the reference to nominal human input after activation.

UNITED STATES,10:24:02,0:00:00,0:05:44,"I think one reaction that we have is that the proposal as we are understanding it, weapon systems that can select and engage a target without further human intervention, that is how we understand the current state of play. That is a very broad definition. It strikes us as potentially a little bit too broad. And so we think that there are some options for trying to be a bit more precise about what we are discussing and to make a little clearer that we are talking about weapons that include systems that have advanced technologies that are performing certain functions. It is a little opaque in this broad definition. And so a couple of ideas that we have would be to highlight the role of the operator and the fact that there is an activation step. We had the word activation. That is one of the words that we have been discussing. But activation is an important idea because it suggests that there is a system in this and that there is a person who is taking responsibility for engaging with that system. The current formulation is ambiguous on that idea. And so working with your text, one way to do that and sorry, one other thought here before proposing something more specific, the reference to human intervention, I think we have been a little concerned that the word human is overly broad as a reference point in relation to the way that a person would engage with the particular weapon and the particular system. For us, we believe we are talking about weapons that are operated by military operators. And so having a term that is a little bit more precise about the nature of the person that is involved in engaging with the machine we think is important. And so the idea that we had would be to at the end of the clause, the current draft reads without further human intervention. I think our idea would be to delete human there and to just add a simple clause at the end that would read without further intervention by the operator so that that gets at the idea that there is a person that is operating the system and then if you tacked on the words after activation, it would I think capture both of the steps that we think are missing in the current definition and be more suggestive of a weapon whose nature is to include the types of technologies that require activation and involvement by the human operator.",[04] Support,"For us, we believe we are talking about weapons that are operated by military operators.

We believe that human control could be included at the end of the second paragraph which in our view better encapsulates human involvement and judgment towards the end of the sentence.,[01] Caveat,limiting further intervention to a single human operator could unnecessarily limit the range of agents that would be involved and thus suggest amending to can select and engage a target without further human intervention at the end of the paragraph.,,,,,[99] Something else,TGT/ENG: [characterization] limiting further intervention to a single human operator could unnecessarily limit the range of agents that would be involved and thus suggest amending to can select and engage a target without further human intervention at the end of the paragraph,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NORWAY,17:57:48,0:00:00,0:01:49,"To our minds, we think selection and engagement probably would be very central, including probably also the application of force with the last very central element to be what is in the last bullet, however one would like to phrase it, human intervention or human involvement intervention by an operator. Of course, an important point was made earlier that you would like this human intervention to be of the right sort but introducing that sort of qualifier into a definition introduces vagueness that sometimes can lead to arguments about whether the human intervention was of the right sort. That being said, and that was the point that I wanted to make now at the end, is that it seems quite clear to me that the sort of human intervention that we are talking about is intervention related to the processes that we have indicated under bullets 3 and 4. Now whether that proviso, that it is that sort of human intervention that we would like to talk about needs to be made explicit in the definition is a question that I would not like to answer at this time but that is something that I pose to the group for consideration.",[99] Something else,"[characterization] we think selection and engagement probably would be very central, including probably also the application of force with the last very central element to be what is in the last bullet, however one would like to phrase it, human intervention or human involvement intervention by an operator",,,,,[99] Something else,"ENG: [characterization][risks] To our minds, we think selection and engagement probably would be very central, including probably also the application of force with the last very central element to be what is in the last bullet, however one would like to phrase it, human intervention or human involvement intervention by an operator [...] unintended engagements",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRAZIL,11:45:22,0:00:00,0:01:52,I think that this question could be perhaps reformulated to focus on the critical aspects that are related in particular to another concept that is crucial to our work which is human control.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SWITZERLAND,15:55:31,0:00:00,0:06:06,"A number of Delegations have already talked about the inclusion of nominal human input. We think it is an important point to discuss and we congratulate you for having put it in here in this text, a text which overall is very focused on realistic. So we really like to have the opportunity to discuss this and in our view it really reflects that the human's role must go beyond the purely nominal input. It must have a certain quality, a quality that allows really some meaningful judgment, meaningful control, whatever we call it. It is not clear to us whether the characterization is the optimal place to put this notion of nominal input. It could also be elsewhere in prohibitions and restrictions and regulations part, but that remains to be seen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COSTA RICA,12:05:40,0:00:00,0:02:30,"And so that is why meaningful human control is a crucial element for our Delegation.

We should have human control there in order to align the language with what we have decided on in other discussions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BRAZIL,11:49:03,0:00:00,0:01:23,"However, like others Brazil believes that the language in the fifth paragraph, quote, appropriate control and human judgments, unquote, should be strengthened in order to explicitly require meaningful human control.

COSTA RICA,11:40:13,0:00:00,0:02:41,"Now, on this specific paragraph that we are analyzing, I would like to underscore that for Costa Rica it is vital to refer to meaningful human control. That is why I would like to echo all of the other Delegations who have suggested adding the qualifier human before control because as explained by the Distinguished Delegation of Switzerland it is vital to be specific as to what type of control we want these systems to have. Otherwise we run the risk that one system will end up controlling another. That is why it is absolutely of vital importance for my Delegation that this paragraph is very clearly reflected and very clearly reflects meaningful human control. At the outset of our discussions it is vital and Costa Rica has already mentioned this when analyzing a possible norm on autonomous systems it is vital that we think about how complex the system is and we should not just base ourselves on the source of IHL as the only channel to create a norm. That is why I think it is important to reflect this as suggested by the Delegation of Cuba. We need to look at other IHL instruments that are necessary to this conversation. Now on the second paragraph I would like to echo what the Delegation of Panama has said. I feel it is necessary to change judgment for control so that we would be consistent in the text.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHILE,12:10:22,0:00:00,0:01:19,Meaningful human control is a vital concept but we could be slightly flexible in order to achieve consensus if necessary.
